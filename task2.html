    <p style="font-size:medium; background-color:coral; color: antiquewhite; font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-weight: 350;"> Minecraft is a video game in which players create
         and break apart various kinds of blocks inthree-dimensional worlds. The gameâ€™s two main modes are 
         Survival and Creative. In Survival,players must find their own building supplies and food. They also
          interact with blocklike mobs,or moving creatures. (Creepers and zombies are some of the dangerous 
          ones.) In Creative, players are given supplies and do not have to eat to survive. They also can break
        all kinds of blocks immediately.<br>
          Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually
         infinite terrain and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build 
        structures, earthworks, and simple machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight
         hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game 
          modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and 
         maintain health) and a creative mode (where players have unlimited resources and access to flight).
         There is also a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, 
        texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.</p>
